## Notes
1. Statues whose objects origin points aren't at the 'ideal' center of an object will more than likely be moved incorrectly.  In the case that you have a few objects like this, you'll have to manually move them.
2. You cannot scale jm's of objects, so all objects will remain the same size.
3. Javascript objects that move with hardcoded coordinates will not be moved.
